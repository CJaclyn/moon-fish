Welcome! 嘲𢜠! This is Moon Fish, a blog centered on **Vietnamese culture**! 
This blog will consist of various topics such as Vietnamese language, music, culture, history, clothing, and much more.

## What is 𩵜月?
𩵜月 is Hán-Nôm for *cá nguyệt*, which means moon fish.

## Why is this blog named Moon Fish 𩵜月? 
It is totally unrealated to the Opah fish, also known as the moonfish.
The name Moon Fish came from my logo, which is based off of the traditional Vietnamese woodblock painting *Lý ngư vọng nguyệt* (鯉魚望月), which means the *The carp looking at the moon*.

## What is Hán-Nôm 漢喃 and why am I using it?
Hán-Nôm or Nôm is Vietnam's old writing script, a mixture of Chinese characters and native Vietnamese characters. I will go in depth on a seperate blog post.
I'm using it because it is an important part of Vietnamese history and I believe it should be revived.

*This website uses Nôm script. Download the Nôm fonts **[here](https://www.hannom-rcv.org/font.html)** to see Nôm characters on this website (and your computer). 
Unfortunately, there are no fonts for mobile devices so you will see squares instead of Nôm characters when using a mobile device.
