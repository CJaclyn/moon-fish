## Vietnamese terms in this post
+ áo dài (襖𨱽)
+ áo ngũ thân (襖五身) 
+ Nhà Nguyễn (茹阮) 
+ Việt phục cách tân (越服革新) 
+ Đại Việt (大越) 

Everyone knows that the **áo dài** is the **national costume of Vietnam**, but not many people know that the áo dài is not *that* old and it's older predecessor is the **áo ngũ thân** from the **Nguyễn dynasty**. 
Technically the áo ngũ thân and áo dài are the same, though we refer to the altered/modern áo ngũ thân as áo dài and the áo ngũ thân as the original from the Nguyễn dynasty. 
This is done so there's less confusion and we can separate the two styles. 
I will go into detail about the history of the áo dài and the áo ngũ thân in another post.\
In this post, I'm going to be discussing how much I hate this popular new áo dài for men that came into existence in the 2000s.
This is not to say I am against innovation of traditional clothes and *only* like the historical ones. I just like good innovation (I'm a fan of **Việt phục cách tân**) and this is definitely NOT one of them.\
\
Reasons why I hate the modern áo dài for men:
+ These new áo dài are often made of thick fabric which causes the áo dài to look very stiff. It almost looks like they're wearing paper.
+ The designs are often tacky, making the áo dài look cheap even when they aren't. The áo dài in the photo above are both over $250.
+ Designers sometimes get too ambitious and end up creating áo dài that don't even resemble áo dài anymore.
+ THE. SKINNY. JEANS. If you're going to wear western pants with the áo dài, at least a looser style. 
+ Unlike the women's modern áo dài, the men's do not have raglan sleeves. 
Instead, these áo dài have set-in sleeves, which when combined with the thick fabric, makes the wearer's shoulders look like blocks.
This sleeve cut *would* be fine if they used lighter fabric.

The three guys in the picture above are all wearing áo ngũ thân of different types of light fabric.
The usage of lighter fabric and the cut of the sleeves makes it drape nicely on the body and comfortable to wear.
Instead of raglan sleeves or set-in sleeves, the áo ngũ thân sleeves connect to the body at the upper arms. Because of this, their shoulders are nicely rounded instead of blocky.
These three áo ngũ thân cost LESS than the modern áo dài above, yet they look more elegant, more comfortable, and more classy than the modern áo dài.
There is no comparison between the the modern áo dài and it's predecessor. The áo ngũ thân is better than the modern áo dài in every way. Newer does not always mean better.
